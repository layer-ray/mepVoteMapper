An application used to check out how meps voted during a plenary roll call votes.

Technically will be a data scraping project, where data will be collected through the eu official sites ([eu plenary - home](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/plenary/en/home.html), [eu MEPs - home](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/home)) in few different formats (html, xml, docx), translated to javascript objects and stored in a mongodb database.

A front end to visualize the data collected will be built too.
